        <p class="SustText">Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action behind the words,
          considering all stakeholders and always aiming a little bit higher when creating another collection. As a
          young, global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for own sake, but for all
          future generations to come.

          Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon footprint to an absolute minimum as
          well as making conscious decisions concerning the social impact on the communities in the countries, in which
          we operate.

          As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”. We believe that this small change further
          represents a new and greener future for SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products in better
          materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will start implementing more conscious initiatives within
          the company, and we hope that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as we are all in this together!

          As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that we have a responsibility. Our focus is to make
          as green a production as possible, and we will continue to launch new initiatives to lower our carbon
          footprint even further.

          Read our principles below.</p>

        <h2>PEOPLE</h2>
        <p class="SustText">At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning obligations. It is not only the
          environment, we must care for, but also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that it is
          our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct within our organization, including all our
          suppliers. We ensure the ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our suppliers do not
          support or make use of child labor. We encourage our factories to ensure that all families have the
          possibility to put their children in school.</p>

        <p class="peopleText">Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as well as their family.
          Our factories also
          grant pensions to all employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.
          We support the different religions of employees and protect their right to engage with rituals, prayers etc.
          at any time. </p>

        <p class="peopleText">We condemn discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from prejudice
          and injustice at the
          workplace.
          We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the issued principles regarding working
          conditions, quality, pollution etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is always
          crafted in a responsible manner.
          All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.</p>

        <h2>TRANSPORT</h2>
        <img id="transportation" src="/images/ship-train-earth.png" alt="Train Earth and Ship illustrations">

        <p class="SustText">We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on our planet. Because of
          this, we strive to
          choose environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in close contact with other brands in
          our aim to minimize shipping as much as possible – by joining forces. We strive to ship as much as possible in
          bulk – mostly by sea or train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping, reducing
          polluting emissions.</p>
